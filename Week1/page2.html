    <p>Being the graduating class of 2020 came with a lot of mixed feelings for me.
    <br>    
    I absolutely loved being at home. Some people say they canâ€™t stay home for long but I can stay forever, honestly. 
    <br>
    Why anyone wants to leave is a mystery to me.</p> 

    <p>The only real thing that I missed was prom which is truly surprising for an introvert like me. 
    <br>
    The fact that my social battery lasted for a few hours the first time I went to the dance was unbelievable. 
    <br>    
    But honestly, I had so much fun then and I wanted to go again <a href="page3.html">for the last time...</a></p>
