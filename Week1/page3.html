   <p>Being the graduating class of 2020 came with a lot of mixed feelings for me.
    <br>    
    I absolutely loved being at home. Some people say they can’t stay home for long but I can stay forever, honestly. 
    <br>
    Why anyone wants to leave is a mystery to me.</p> 

    <p>The only real thing that I missed was prom which is truly surprising for an introvert like me. 
    <br>
    The fact that my social battery lasted for a few hours the first time I went to the dance was unbelievable. 
    <br>    
    But honestly, I had so much fun then and I wanted to go again for the last time.</p>

    <p>And it never happened. Now, I can’t say that I’m upset about the reason prom was canceled but missing out on senior prom was a bit sad. 
    <br>    
    It’s probably the most over-glorified event in history. 
    <br>    
    Okay, that’s clearly an exaggeration but think about it.
    <br>    
    Was your high school experience anything like the popular Disney original movie series High School Musical?
