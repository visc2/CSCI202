                <h1>Why do you even like True Crime? That's scary and weird!</h1>
                <p>I get this question a lot. True crime is a lot more than just some heists, and kidnappings. These are real people's lives. It's not something to take lightly. What I'm really interested in is how the crime came to be and got ... executed. Maybe not the best word choice, but anyways, I just the stories. The strength of survivers, the twists and turns of bank robberies,the unbelievable amount of victims. I alwys find myself in a mix of emotions over what happened whether the bad guy gets caught or the story ends unsolved. Now, don't go around thinking I'm some murder obsessed freak or anything like that. I have a great deal of respect and empathy towards vitims and their families. It's not necessarily about the murder, it's about the <i>psychology</i>.</p>
                <p>I like to watch videos and documentaries the best. You got to be careful of what you are watching, though. Some documentaries can include some very gory images but you can head over to the resources page for my go-to, minimal-gore selections. Podcasts are also super fun to put on when you can't sit down and watch. Podcasts have a much wider selection of genres because of the hosts. My favorite true crime podcasts include an element of comedy to lighten the mood and get through story. Most people think this is disrespectful by adding a comedy element to the topic of people being brutally murdered, but that's not where the jokes are directed. Take a listen and you'll understand, I promise.</p>
