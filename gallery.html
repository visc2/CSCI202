                    <td>On November 13, 1974, an estate in the town of Amityville was the scene of mass murder. Using a .35 Marlin rifle, 23-year-old Ronald J. DeFeo Jr. murdered his entire family while they were asleep, which included his parents and four siblings. Thirteen months later, the Lutz family purchased the home at a drastically reduced price of $80,000 (due to the murders) but only lasted 28 days before leaving it. They claimed to have experienced spine-tingling tales of paranormal activity. George Lutz was said to wake up at 3:15 am every morning, which was around the time Ron carried out his murders. The Lutz family claimed to smell strange odors, see green slime oozing out of the walls and keyholes and experience cold spots in certain areas of the house. When a priest came to bless the house, he allegedly heard a voice scream "Get out!" He told the Lutzes to never sleep in that particular room in the house. Other paranormal activity: A nearby garage door opening and closing; an invisible spirit knocking a knife down in the kitchen; a pig-like creature with red eyes staring down at George and his son Daniel from a window; George waking up to wife Kathy levitating off their bed; sons Daniel and Christopher also levitating together in their beds.</td>

                    <td>15-year-old Mary Vincent ran away from her home in Las Vegas, Nevada and headed toward California. Lawrence Singleton slowed down his van to pick up Mary Vincent in Berkeley, CA, on the morning of September 29, 1978. Despite his façade, middle-aged Singleton reportedly had a temper and was a misogynist. Vincent had fallen asleep in the car and when she woke up, she realized they were way off course and driving back toward Nevada. Scared and angry, she found a sharp stick in the car and pointed it at Singleton. She demanded he turn the van around and take her to where she was headed. Singleton acquiesced and calmly apologized, reassuring the teen he was “just an honest man who made a mistake.” Vincent believed he was remorseful, and the ride continued. Vincent was attacked by Singleton on a stop for the restroom. Vincent was repeatedly raped until she passed out. When Vincent regained consciousness, Singleton was still there. He ordered her to lie on the edge of the road and she pleaded with him to set her free. He began saying, "You want to be free? I'll set you free," as he went to the van to find something. He returned with a hatchet. Mary struggled as Singleton held her down and cut off her right arm. She screamed as he moved on to the other arm, severing it right below the elbow. He then shoved the naked and bleeding girl down an embankment into a culvert. He stuffed her into a concrete pipe and told her: "Okay, now you're free." He left her there, unconscious and near death.She mustered the strength to stand up and walk three miles out of th culvert, which she later found out was the Del Puerto Canyon. She followed the sounds of the nearby freeway and raised her arms to keep the bleeding to a minimum. Upon reaching the freeway, the first people who spotted her sped away in fear. A second couple, who had been traveling on vacation, stopped to help her. They wrapped her in linens from their car before driving her to a nearby airport. There, they called an ambulance.</td>

He would then take them to his homemade torture chamber, the "Toy Box", which was filled with sex toys, surgical instruments, chains, pulleys, straps, clamps, spreader bars, syringes and diagrams of the human body. There was also a gynecology table that the victims would be restrained in, a mirror mounted on the ceiling so that they would be able to see themselves be raped and tortured, and a device for electric torture. Ray would record the torture, either by audio or with a video camera, and take trophies such as clothing and jewelry. At least some of the victims were let go after a few days. Ray claimed to have drugged them to make them forget about what happened. According to Cindy Hendy, the fatal victims were dismembered and buried, dumped in the Elephant Butte Lake or dumped in ravines."</td>

Legend has it that one day an attendant girl was brushing Elizabeth’s hair when she accidentally pulled too hard and it tugged on a snag in her hair. The countess erupted in anger, jumping up and striking the girl with the back of her hand. The strike was so hard that it made the girl bleed and some of that blood was left on Elizabeth’s hand. Later that night, Elizabeth noticed that the skin on her hand where the blood had been looked more youthful than she had seen it in many years. This gave her the idea that if such a small amount of blood could make her hand look so young, then more could restore youthfulness to her whole body. It’s said that this is when the madness began and Elizabeth started to bathe in the blood of virgin girls. Young women began to disappear from villages near and far, as well as children. Unhappy girls were lured to the castle with the prospect that they would find work there but were never seen again. When they arrived, they were locked up in a cellar as they awaited torture.""</td>

The infamous couple also ran an illegal adoption center at the time and if the kids were not "marketable", meaning disabled, deformed, ill or even were of a mixed race, they would be refused medical care and were put on a diet of molasses and water until they starved.

He usually abducted them by simply bringing them over to his house, where he proceeded to either drug them or attack them. He also tortured his captives in many ways (Which I won't include here. This probably needs a level 6). Whenever one of them disobeyed him, he would force her into a four-foot-deep pit filled with water and place a wooden board weighed down with stones so she could not escape. He would then place an electrical cable that wasn't insulated on one end and connected to an outlet on the other through a gap in the board to electrocute her. In an attempt to deafen his victims so they would not be able to hear him come down the basement, he cuffed each victim's hands and feet together, hung them from a basement beam, gagged them, and gouged different-sized screwdrivers into their ears. He did not do this to Rivera due to her compliance and telling him about his victims' escape attempts. During their captivity, he fed them food, the amount and type varying based on his mood, dog food, and even forced them to eat Lindsay's body.".</td>

For over 40 years, Elan subjected thousands of children to daily abuse, torture, dehumanization, and psychological and physical terror. Their leadership actively encouraged and participated in these horrific activities, taking advantage of their status in order to do so. But the worst part is that everything Elan did - the torture, the terror, the abuse - was completely legal. And, unbelievably, it still is." It was finally shutdown in 2011.</td>

Possibly a transgender person. When someone was arrested running away from a murder scene, the whole investigation was turned on its head. The prime suspect of the serial murders turned out to be a woman. 48-year-old retired Lucha Libre wrestler, Juana Barraza."</td>

To this day, law enforcement officials have been unable to discover the true identity of the murderer, despite the fact that they have a list of potential suspects, two of whom are already dead. The stuff of a mystery television show, the Bone Collector's saga will leave you with goosebumps. All of the West Mesa Bone Collector's victims fall between the ages of 15 and 32, fit a specific profile, were suspected to be involved in the Albuquerque drug scene, and worked as prostitutes. Like many other infamous unsolved murders, the true identity of the West Mesa Bone Collector remains a mystery due to a lack of new evidence, and it's likely that these crimes will remain unsolved until someone comes forward."</td>
