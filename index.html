            <h6>-My Favorite Murder</h6>
            <p class="big-left">True Crime is a genre of non-fiction literacy and film. True Crime examines actual crimes and gets into the details of the people invloved. Most of the time, the cases covered in the true crime genre are murders, but there is plenty of gangsters, kidnapping, missing people, poisonings, accidents, and other topics included. You can find true crime in several different forms like movies, documentaries, books, TV shows, and podcasts. True Crime is truly a fascinating topic. True Crime gives us a look into the minds of notorious killers and criminals. For some people, it makes them feel more prepared. Women make up a majority of murder victims, so maybe that is why women like true crime? Do whatever you can so you're not the next victim. Or maybe it's simply to understand the world that we live in. Either way, there's a mystery to solve, and who doesn't want to take part in craking the code?</p>

            <p class="big-right">A bonus topic: The supernatural. Aliens, ghosts, spontaneous combustion, strange diseases. Some of the cases I know of are Gloria Ramirez, the Lizzie Borden House, the Salem Witch Trials, Waverly Hills Hospital, and the Goatman. You can check out these stories on pages of the YouTubers and Podcasts on the Resources Page!</p>
